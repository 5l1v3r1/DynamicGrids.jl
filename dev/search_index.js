Each rule triggers a specific applyrule method that operates on each of the cells in the grid. Rules come in a number of flavours (outlined in the docs), which allows assumptions to be made about running them that can greatly improve performance. Rules are joined in a Ruleset object and run in sequence.\n\nInit\n\nThe init array may be any AbstractArray, containing whatever initialisation data is required to start the simulation. The array type and element type of the init array determine the types used in the simulation, as well as providing the initial conditions. An init array can be attached to a Ruleset or passed into a simulation (the latter will take preference).\n\nOutputs\n\nOutputs (in AbstractOuput) are ways of storing of viewing a simulation. They can be used interchangeably depending on your needs: ArrayOutput is a simple storage structure for high performance-simulations. The REPLOutput can be useful for checking a simulation when working in a terminal or over ssh.\n\nDynamicGridsInteract.jl provides simulation interfaces for use in Juno, Jupyter, web pages or electron apps, with live interactive control over parameters. DynamicGridsGtk.jl is a simple graphical output for Gtk. These packages are kept separate to avoid dependencies when being used in non-graphical simulations. Outputs are also easy to write, and high performance or applications may benefit from writing a custom output to reduce memory use, while custom frame processors can help developing specialised visualisations.\n\nSimulations\n\nA typical simulation is run with a script like:\n\ninit = my_array\nrules = Ruleset(Life(); init=init)\noutput = ArrayOutput(init)\n\nsim!(output, rules)\n\nMultiple models can be passed to sim! in a Ruleset. Each rule will be run for the whole grid, in sequence, using appropriate optimisations depending on the parent types of the rules.\n\nsim!(output, Ruleset(rule1, rule2); init=init)\n\nFor better performance (often ~2x), models included in a Chain object will be combined into a single model, using only one array read and write. This optimisation is limited to AbstractCellRule, or an AbstractNeighborhoodRule followed by AbstractCellRule. If the @inline compiler macro is used on all applyrule methods, rules in a Chain will be compiled together into a single function call.\n\nsim!(output, Rules(rule1, Chain(rule2, rule3)); init=init)\n\nDynamicGrids.jl is extended by Dispersal.jl for modelling organism dispersal. Dispersal.jl is a useful template for writing other extensions, and includes many Rules, as well as a custom frame procesor for display and output for better simulation performance.\n\nFuture work\n\nMulti-entity simulations\n\nUsing the same architecture we can simulate multiple entities and their interactions in a single simulations. This will involve using arrays of static arrays (and LabelledArrays). Each field of these arrays may have custom rules or similar rules with different parameters, anbd may also have rules that define how they interact. This will enable previously unavailable multi-species, multi-genome, multi age-class dispersal models in ecology, and likely other applications in other fields. \n\nA DSL is being developed to write these complex models with a similar syntax, that will also enable further performance optimisations.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#Examples-1","page":"DynamicGrids.jl","title":"Examples","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"DynamicGrids.jl","title":"DynamicGrids.jl","text":"While this package isn't designed or optimised specifically to run the game of life, it's a simple example of what this package can do.
